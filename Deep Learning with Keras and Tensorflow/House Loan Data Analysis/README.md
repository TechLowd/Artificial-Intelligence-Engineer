In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.<br>
<br>
<strong>Objective: </strong>Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.</p>
<p><strong>Domain: </strong>Finance</p>
<p><strong>Analysis to be done: </strong>Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to be done:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Load the dataset that is given to you<br>
⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check for null values in the dataset<br>
⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Print percentage of default to payer of the dataset for the TARGET column<br>
⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Balance the dataset if the data is imbalanced<br>
⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plot the balanced data or imbalanced data<br>
⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Encode the columns that is required for the model<br>
⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calculate Sensitivity as a metrice<br>
⦁&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calculate area under receiver operating characteristics curve</p>
